React Fundamentals & Rendering
1. How does React re-rendering work?
2. Difference between state vs props
3. Difference between refs vs state
4. Why refs don’t trigger re-renders
5. Why props look the same but still cause re-render (identity vs equality)
6. Why keys are required in React lists
7. What happens if keys are missing or not unique
8. How does React reconciliation work?
9. Explain React Fiber
10. Why React.memo sometimes doesn’t work

🪝 Hooks & Effects
1. Why does useEffect run twice in Strict Mode (dev only)?
2. What are non-idempotent effects?
3. How does useEffect cleanup work?
4. What happens if cleanup is missing in useEffect?
5. Why state becomes stale inside useEffect
6. How to fix stale closures
7. When to use functional state updates (setState(prev => …))
8. When should useEffect be split
9. When should useEffects be combined
10. Difference between useEffect vs useLayoutEffect

🧠 State Management & Architecture
1. When does state colocation beat lifting state
2. Why derived state is an anti-pattern
3. Why derived data should not be stored in state
4. When to avoid state and use derived UI
5. Why Context causes re-render storms
6. When should Context NOT be used
7. Difference between Context vs Redux vs Zustand
8. Why selector-based state libraries (Zustand) reduce re-renders
9. Signals vs stores vs context — why subscriptions matter
10. When to rely on server-cached state instead of lifting state

⚡ Performance & Optimization
1. What causes unnecessary re-renders
2. Difference between useMemo vs useCallback
3. When should useMemo / useCallback be avoided
4. Why referential stability matters
5. How function props break React.memo
6. How to debug re-renders using React Profiler
7. What causes render loops
8. How automatic batching works in React 18

🧵 Concurrency & Scheduling (React 18 / 19)
1. Difference between legacy sync rendering vs concurrent rendering
2. Why interruptible rendering is important
3. What are lanes in React and how they control priority
4. How the Fiber scheduler pauses, resumes, abandons work
5. When to use useTransition
6. Difference between useTransition vs startTransition
7. How useDeferredValue avoids UI lag
8. Role of Offscreen rendering

🌊 Suspense, Streaming & Hydration
1. What changed with Suspense in React 18 streaming
2. Why hydration mismatch happens even if HTML matches
3. Difference between full vs progressive hydration
4. What is selective hydration
5. What is lazy hydration
6. What is React Flight
7. What causes client waterfalls with RSC
8. Why streaming renders shell first, details later

🧩 Events & Internals
1. What are Synthetic Events in React?
2. Why does React attach event listeners at the root
3. How does React know which element triggered the event
4. How does event delegation work in React
5. How do portals work with event bubbling

🧱 Error Handling
1. What are Error Boundaries
2. What errors Error Boundaries cannot catch

🧪 Components & Forms ✅ (THIS WAS MISSED EARLIER — NOW FIXED)
1. Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
2. Render cost comparison of controlled vs uncontrolled components
