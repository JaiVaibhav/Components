Rendering & Performance Scenarios
1️⃣ Scroll Jank Scenario
Users report UI freezes while scrolling a feed after the app has been open for a while. APIs are fast, but Performance tab shows long tasks and layout recalculations.
How do you debug and fix this?

2️⃣ Unnecessary Re-renders
A dashboard page re-renders multiple times even when user input hasn’t changed. React Profiler shows repeated renders of child components.
How do you identify the cause and reduce renders?

3️⃣ Large List Performance
A page renders 20k rows. Initial load is fine, but scrolling becomes slow over time.
What architectural changes would you make?

4️⃣ React.memo Not Working
You wrapped a component with React.memo, but it still re-renders on every parent update.
What could be the reasons and how do you fix it?

5️⃣ Infinite Scroll Bug
Infinite scroll sometimes fetches the same page twice and sometimes skips data.
What could be wrong in the implementation?

🔹 State & Effects Scenarios
6️⃣ useEffect Loop
A component enters a render loop after adding a useEffect.
How do you debug and refactor it?

7️⃣ Stale State Bug
A WebSocket listener logs outdated state values even though state updates correctly elsewhere.
Why does this happen and how do you fix it?

8️⃣ Context Performance Issue
After adding one value to Context, the entire app feels slower.
What went wrong and how would you redesign it?

9️⃣ Derived State Bug
State is derived from props using useEffect, and UI sometimes shows incorrect values.
Why does this happen and how should it be fixed?

🔹 Concurrency & Scheduling Scenarios
🔟 Input Lag in React 18
Typing in a search box becomes laggy when results update.
How do React 18 features help here?

1️⃣1️⃣ Urgent vs Non-Urgent Updates
A page has both animations and heavy data rendering. Animations stutter when data updates.
How do you prioritize updates?

1️⃣2️⃣ Suspense Misuse
Wrapping a large page in a single <Suspense> causes blank screens.
How would you redesign Suspense boundaries?

🔹 Browser & Event Loop Scenarios
1️⃣3️⃣ UI Freezes Without Errors
JS CPU usage spikes, but no errors appear.
How do you debug this using browser tools?

1️⃣4️⃣ Scroll Event Performance
Scroll handlers cause performance degradation even with throttling.
What browser APIs would you consider instead?

1️⃣5️⃣ Event Listener Leak
Performance degrades after navigating between pages multiple times.
What could be leaking and how do you find it?

🔹 Networking & Real-Time Scenarios
1️⃣6️⃣ Real-Time Feed Jank
Messages arrive via WebSocket, but UI becomes sluggish as message count grows.
What changes do you make?

1️⃣7️⃣ Race Condition in Fetching
User switches tabs quickly and sees incorrect data.
How do you prevent this?

1️⃣8️⃣ Offline/Online Transitions
App behaves unpredictably when network drops and reconnects.
How do you design resilience?

🔹 Architecture & System Design Scenarios
1️⃣9️⃣ Micro-Frontend Performance
Each micro-frontend loads independently but page load time is high.
How do you optimize overall UX?

2️⃣0️⃣ Shared Component Library Issue
Updating a shared UI component breaks multiple teams’ apps.
How do you prevent this?

2️⃣1️⃣ Feature Flag Complexity
Feature flags start causing tangled logic and bugs.
How do you redesign flag usage?

2️⃣2️⃣ Legacy Migration
You need to migrate a large legacy UI incrementally without breaking users.
What strategy do you follow?

🔹 Debugging & Production Scenarios
2️⃣3️⃣ Memory Leak in Production
Memory usage grows over time in production but not locally.
How do you investigate and fix it?

2️⃣4️⃣ Performance Regression After Release
Core Web Vitals regress after a release.
How do you identify the root cause quickly?

2️⃣5️⃣ Error Boundary Not Catching Errors
A production crash bypasses Error Boundaries.
Why can this happen and how do you handle it?
Accessibility & UX Failure Scenarios (Very Common, Often Missed)
26️⃣ Accessibility Regression
After a UI refactor, keyboard navigation breaks and screen-reader users report issues.
How do you debug and fix this without rolling back the entire release?

27️⃣ Focus Loss Bug
Users report that focus jumps unexpectedly when modals open/close or lists update.
What are the likely causes and how do you design predictable focus management?

🟡 Forms, Inputs & IME Scenarios (High-signal)
28️⃣ Input Lag in Forms
Controlled inputs feel laggy during fast typing, especially on low-end devices.
Why does this happen and how do you fix it without losing control?

29️⃣ IME Bug
Users using non-English keyboards (IME) report broken input behavior.
What’s happening and how do you handle composition events correctly?

🟠 CSS & Layout System Scenarios
30️⃣ Layout Thrashing via CSS
A UI looks simple but causes frequent reflows and poor performance.
How do you identify and fix CSS-driven layout thrashing?

31️⃣ CSS-in-JS Performance Regression
After adopting CSS-in-JS, page load time and runtime performance regress.
How do you evaluate whether the trade-off was worth it?

🔵 iFrame & Embedded Content Scenarios
32️⃣ Cross-Domain Communication Bug
An embedded iframe fails to communicate reliably with the parent app.
How do you debug and secure postMessage communication?

33️⃣ Third-Party Script Impact
A third-party widget causes performance and security issues.
How do you sandbox or isolate it?

🟣 Error Handling & Resilience Scenarios
34️⃣ Partial Failure UI
Some APIs succeed while others fail, leaving the UI in an inconsistent state.
How do you design graceful degradation?

35️⃣ Retry Storm
Automatic retries overload the backend and worsen UX.
How do you design safe retry and backoff strategies on the frontend?

🟤 Time, Locale & Globalization Scenarios
36️⃣ Timezone Bug
Users in different timezones see incorrect dates or ordering.
Where do such bugs usually originate and how do you prevent them?

37️⃣ Locale Performance Issue
Switching locales causes large re-renders and performance issues.
How do you architect locale-aware UI efficiently?

🧠 Distributed UI / Consistency Scenarios (Staff-level)
38️⃣ Stale Data UI
UI shows stale data even though the backend is eventually consistent.
How do you design UI to tolerate inconsistency?

39️⃣ Multi-Tab State Sync
The same app open in multiple tabs goes out of sync.
How do you coordinate state across tabs safely?

🔧 Tooling & DX Scenarios
40️⃣ Build Time Explosion
As the app grows, build times become painfully slow.
How do you diagnose and improve build performance?

41️⃣ Feature Flag Debt
Feature flags accumulate and become permanent code paths.
How do you clean this up without breaking production?
